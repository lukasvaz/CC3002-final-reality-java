Context
-------

This project's goal is to create a (simplified) clone of _Final Fantasy_'s combat, a game developed
by [_Square Enix_](https://www.square-enix.com)
Broadly speaking for the combat the player has a group of characters to control and a group of 
enemies controlled by the computer.

------

Run Instructions
-------

This project has two testing files:<em>TimerExample.java</em> and  <em>Main.java</em>.TimerExample will test the 
functionality of the turn system, crating an instance of each class and printing them in the right order.Main.java will 
test the functionality of  every method of each class (i.e. getters ,setters,to string etc).Run both files for testing.

Changes
-------
Some features have been modified to guarante a proper design of the software.Here is  a quick summary of the main 
changes: 

<b>T1</b>
<ol>
<li> A new <em>Abstract Class </em>  called <b><em>AbstractMage</em></b>  class was added to implement the behaviours of 
<em>WhiteMages</em> and  <em>BlackMages</em>. Now the proyect is <b>open</b>
to get new features of <em>Mages</em>.The proyect also got the interface <b><em>PlayerMage</em></b> (extending 
of <em>Playercharacter</em> ) wich guarantees that  methods related to <em>Mages</em> must be implemented in the 
<em>AbstractMage</em> class.</li>
<br>
<li> <b><em>waitTurn()</em></b> was impemented for each <em>Enemy</em> and  <em>AbstractPlayerCharacter</em> 
 classes.The purpouse of this is follow the encapsulation principle where each class handles its funcionalities acording to their weights 
or Weapon´s weights. </li>
<br>
<li> A new class  <b><em>TurnsQueue</em></b> was added following the "single responsability" principle , this class will 
handle the functionalities related to the turns.</li><br>
<li><em>Enemy</em> got  the  method  <b><em>toString</em></b>, now it can be compared consistently with 
the other classes</li>
</ol>

<b>T2</b>
<ol>
<li>A new weapon interface was added,which is implemented by each weapon classes.</li>
<li>Tests were implemented.It was added a unit test for each  player class  and weapon class.</li>

<li> New exceptions were added. <em>NullWeaponException</em> to guarantee the assignment of a weapon to a character
 before it get push to the queue.And also <em>InvalidWeaponAssignentException</em> which throws an error if
the assignment doesn't follow the weapon´s assignment conditions.</li>

<li>Weapon assignment restrictions were implemented.To do this the
<em>Weapon</em> interface got the method <em>equipedby()</em> and  <em>PlayerCharacter</em> 
interface got the methods <em>equipSword()</em>,<em>equipAxe()</em> 
,<em>equipKnife()</em>, <em>equipStaff()</em> and equipBow()</em>.<br>
Following the double dispatch design pattern,the method <em>equip()</em> in <em>AbstractPlayerCharacter</em> calls the method <em>equipedby()</em>
in <em>Weapon</em> (first dispatch) in order to disambiguate the weapon.Then the method 
<em>equippedby()</em> calls the respective method to equip the weapon in the 
differents characters classes (double dispatch).</li>

</ol>
